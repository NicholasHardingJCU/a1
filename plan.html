Goals

The Slammers Beach Volleyball website is intended to increase Slammers' customer base of at least 50% by promoting both their services (venue hiring, competitions etc) and their business online on the internet. This is planned to maintain existing customers and attract new customers to the business.

Success Evaluation

The client has stated in their business description that they achieve about 100 players each week at the venue. The success of the created website will be determined through the amount of customers joining and playing each week at Slammers (This could also be determined through how many teams are registered, if there are . If the business achieves over 150 players each week at the venue, then the intention of the website given by the client will be seen as successful.

Target Audience

Slammers' current customer base majorly consists of players ages 35-50. The website that is to be developed will be intended to appeal to younger audiences from ages 15-30; attempting to draw them into playing the sport while in high school or university. It is estimated that since younger persons are more competitive, they will be drawn to watch and play competitively more if they knew about Slammers in the first place. This website will suit the target audience by using images of person/s playing Volleyball that are in the same age group as those targeted, as well as an appealing color scheme.

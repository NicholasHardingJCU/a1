  <h2> Beach Volleyball - Assessment 1</h2>
  
  <p>&lt;Nicholas Harding &amp; JC427914&gt; </p>
  
<h2>Mission Statement</h2>
	 
 	 <p>The Slammers Beach Volleyball website is intended to increase Slammers' customer base of at least 50% by promoting both their services (venue hiring, competitions etc) and their business online on the internet. This is planned to maintain existing customers and attract new customers to the business. </p>
     
<h2>Success Evaluation</h2>
 
	 <p>The client has stated in their business description that they achieve about 100 players each week at the venue. The success of the created website will be determined through the amount of customers joining and playing each week at Slammers. If the business achieves over 150 players each week at the venue, then the intention of the website given by the 						         client will be seen as successful.</p>
            
<h2>Target Audience</h2>

	<p>Slammers' current customer base majorly consists of players ages 35-50. The website that is to be developed will be intended to appeal to younger audiences; attempting to draw them into playing the sport while in high school or university (ages 15-30). It is guessed that since younger persons are more competitive, they will be drawn to watch and play competitively more if they knew about Slammers in the first place.</p>
